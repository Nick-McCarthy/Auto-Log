## Purpose

AutoLog is a website that allows the user to track their vehicle maintenance history. Users may store a list of their vehicles and attach them to their account. By entering service records such as oil changes, a service history is stored including the date of the maintenance and mileage at the time. This tool is a simple way to get a leg up with insurance and resell value.
